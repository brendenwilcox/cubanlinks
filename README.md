Our goal for making this website was to create an online store for The Lost Reserve.  We wanted to provide the clothing sold at the store in an online format and provide a way to reserve it for the client.  We created pages for each type of clothing and had multiple items on each page.  On our home page we provided what the stores purpose is, what people who have been there think, and links to their social media with contact information.  Brenden worked on all the design code of the website and made the entire homepage along with the header and footer. Dan worked on the clothing pages and designed the easy to use cards for the website, he obtained all of the pictures for the websites and provided the prices and descriptions for the clothes after helping with the html and css of the shirts page.  After the cards were created, Brenden added the hover overlay and the clothing pages were complete.  Sy worked on getting information for the cards and he also worked on the basic layout of the website. He also did the tee’s page for the website and worked on the reserve function, but he didn’t have time to finish the rest.

Our website was created so that people would be able to shop and view what The Lost Reserve has to offer and to push more customers to go to our client’s store downtown.

Website Features-
-	We added on the website a review area on the home page, before the original website of the Lost reserve didn’t have this and we as a team decided this would be necessary.

-	We also decided that we needed a attention grabber so we created the blinking button that is at the top of the screen every time you refresh the home page.

-	We did not like how our information was for the items on the cards so Brenden decided that a hover feature would be necessary to make the card display the information better.

-	At the footer we believed that it is important to create links that would bring the customers to the owner’s social medias because this could potential make him grow bigger and reach other people.
